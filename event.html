      <p>Asides from calculating and designing,we found out that some engineering students are talented in public speaking and writing;and this was why the Ules Orators &Writers club was created.<br>The orators are trained by professionals and participate in debates which leads them to the Debate Championship.<br>The writers are given writing challenges every week and a writer of the week is selected and celebrated.</p>
